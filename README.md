Day 5 This was a creator day, for my creator day I used the dip switch to individually turn on the rgb lights.
Day 10 This was the second creator day, I used the photoresistor to turn the led bulb on and off, if I covered the photoresistor the led would turn on, if I un covered the photoresistor the led would turn off
